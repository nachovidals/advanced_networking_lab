This project is designed to provide a similar ecosystem for the core (EPC) and a access-network (EUTRAN) of 3GPP cellular systems. The goal is to support the interoperability between open-source and closed-source equipment across different sections of cellular networks.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "OpenAirInterface (OAI) is considered open source, but it operates under a specialized licensing model that aligns with the intellectual property policies of 3GPP, the body governing cellular standards. This makes its license slightly different from typical open-source licenses to accommodate the complex IP landscape of the telecom industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points of OAI's Licensing Model:\n",
    "3GPP Compatibility: The license is designed to be compatible with 3GPP intellectual property rights, allowing contributions from members holding patents on key technologies.\n",
    "Collaborative: It supports and encourages contributions from both industry and academia, fostering a collaborative development environment.\n",
    "Open Source with IP Respect: While it allows users to freely use, modify, and redistribute the software, it ensures that these activities respect the existing patents and IP rights essential in the telecom sector.\n",
    "This specialized approach enables OAI to maintain the open-source ethos of transparency and collaboration, while also navigating the specific legal and IP requirements of the telecommunications industry."

Each of these subfolders contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that you will eventually use to spin up the components. For an introduction to the YAML format, see [this tutorial](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml).
